  I attended the festival on its second day with a single goal in mind - to witness the enchanting performance of 'Tigapagi,' a folk music group that held a special place in my heart. Little did I know that the day would unfold with a myriad of exciting acts, including the adventure-filled concert by Sherina, a soul-stirring Tribute to God Bless, and numerous other remarkable performances that left an indelible mark on my festival experience.
